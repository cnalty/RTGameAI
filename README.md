#RTGameAI

This is a repository designed to perform training of neural networks in PyTorch. It has been tested on Linear and Conv2d Layers. There are a few games added to demonstrate the training of networks. Including:
The game of life: Animal blocks try to collect the most amount of food blocks as possible.
Flapp Dot: A Flappy Bird Clone
Snake: Snake (this game seems to have issues, known bugs being looked at)
